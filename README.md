# SFML-Project-Setup

Hello dear friend, welcome! I made this setup for you. There is no need to deal with project properties anymore. Just download this project and open the solution file. Then start making games with SFML. Don't forget this setup is for Visual Studio 2022. Enjoy!

I also write a simple code for you, after download the setup you can try to run it.
